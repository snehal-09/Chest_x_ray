# Chest_x_ray
Chest X-Ray Disease Classification  This project focuses on automatically detecting and classifying chest diseases from X-ray images using Deep Learning techniques. It aims to assist radiologists in early diagnosis by providing accurate and fast predictions.

🔍 Overview

The model is trained on a Chest X-Ray dataset (e.g., NIH or Kaggle dataset) containing labeled images of various lung conditions such as:

Pneumonia

Tuberculosis

COVID-19

Normal (healthy lungs)

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

⚙️ Features

Preprocessing of X-ray images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)

CNN-based deep learning model for disease detection

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Option to upload and predict new X-ray images

🚀 Future Improvements

Integration with web app (Streamlit/Flask) for user-friendly interface

Multi-class classification for multiple chest diseases

Use of transfer learning models like ResNet, DenseNet, or VGG

📊 Results

The model achieved high accuracy in classifying chest X-rays into disease categories and shows potential as a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals.
